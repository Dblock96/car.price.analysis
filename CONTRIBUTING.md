# Contributing to Car Price Analysis - Hamza Hackathon Team 3

Welcome to our hackathon project! We're excited to have you contribute to our car price analysis tool. This guide will help you get started and ensure smooth collaboration among team members.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Our team is building a comprehensive car price analysis dashboard that:
- Provides interactive data exploration of car pricing factors
- Offers machine learning-based price predictions
- Delivers actionable insights for car buyers and sellers
- Demonstrates best practices in data science and web development

## 🏗️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git for version control
- A GitHub account

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car.price.analysis.git
   cd car.price.analysis
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**
   - The app should open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
   - Navigate through all pages to ensure everything works

## 🔄 Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/your-feature-name`: Individual feature development
- `bugfix/issue-description`: Bug fixes

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clean, well-commented code
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Test your changes locally

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
   ```

4. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use the GitHub web interface
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Link any relevant issues

## 📝 Code Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:
```python
def calculate_price_prediction(features: dict) -> float:
    """
    Calculate car price prediction based on input features.
    
    Args:
        features (dict): Dictionary containing car features
        
    Returns:
        float: Predicted price in USD
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Streamlit Components
- Use clear section headers and subheaders
- Add helpful tooltips and descriptions
- Ensure responsive design
- Test with different screen sizes

### Data Science Code
- Document data sources and assumptions
- Include validation checks for data quality
- Use appropriate visualizations
- Explain model choices and parameters

## 🧪 Testing

### Before Submitting
- [ ] Test the Streamlit app runs without errors
- [ ] Verify all visualizations display correctly
- [ ] Check that new features work as expected
- [ ] Ensure no regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Test with different data inputs

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] Interactive elements respond correctly
- [ ] Predictions generate reasonable results
- [ ] Visualizations are clear and informative

## 📊 Data Guidelines

### Working with Data
- Use the cleaned dataset: `data/car_price_clean.csv`
- Validate data inputs before processing
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Document any data transformations

### Adding New Features
- Consider data availability and quality
- Test with edge cases and outliers
- Provide fallback options for missing data
- Document feature engineering steps

## 🤝 Team Communication

### Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Code discussions
- **Commit Messages**: Clear, descriptive changes

### Best Practices
- Be respectful and constructive in reviews
- Ask questions if something is unclear
